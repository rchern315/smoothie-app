# Smoothie App

A fun little dashboard built with **React**, **Supabase**, and deployed on **Vercel**.

Right now, it displays just two smoothie titles — but soon it’ll showcase full smoothie details, including **titles, images, descriptions, and ratings**. It will also feature **adding** and **deleting** smoothies in real time, powered by a connected Supabase database.

## Why Smoothies?

Because I’d been craving one all day… so I figured, _why not code it instead?_  
Plus, it turned out to be the perfect excuse to play with Supabase — which has been **super easy and intuitive** to use.
